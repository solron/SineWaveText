A short demo on how to create old school sine wave text from the demoscene in 80s and 90s.

We use a spritesheet font to have controll over each character. Then we can also use the script and font for any kind of text. The text would not require to be made in photshop or any other image software.

Two sprite sheets with C64 fonts are included. Commodore stole the font them self, so I'm pretty sure it is not copyrighted.

The background music included is: Arcade Music Loop.wav from freesound.org
Made by: joshuaempyre

Turned this one into a more complete 80s intro
